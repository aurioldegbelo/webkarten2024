Data for the project work for the course Webbasierte Karten und WebGIS at TU Dresden (SoSe 2024). The data features: 
* Five datasets that should generate an error: empty.json (empty file), invalid_1.json (inappropriate content), invalid_2.json (ill-formated json), invalid_3.json (the data includes only one place, which is outside Saxony), invalid_4.json (the data includes several places, of which one is outside Saxony)
* dresden.json for the coordinates of Dresden
* sachsen.json for the boundaries of the state of Saxony
  
Coordinates of places are crude approximations (e.g. points instead of polygons), taken from the respective Wikipedia articles, for the purpose of the exercise only.
